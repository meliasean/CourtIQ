Score Beijing 2026 QF.

All 4 matches resolved. Winners derived from the SF field: every player
contesting an SF match necessarily won their QF match. Both SF pairings were
checked against adjacent QF bracket slots - (1,2) and (3,4) - and both line
up, which is what confirms the round is complete rather than partially read.
