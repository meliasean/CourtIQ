Score Shanghai 2026 QF.

All 4 matches resolved. Winners derived from the SF field: both semi-finalists
in each half necessarily won their QF match. Each SF pairing was asserted
against adjacent QF bracket slots - match k must pair the winners of QF
(2k-1, 2k), in that order - and both hold.

All four QF favourites held, the only round of the event with no upsets.
